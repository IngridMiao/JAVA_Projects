# JAVA_Projects
Two projects, Course Registration System Optimization, Paperless Career Fair, are here.
In both files, there are reasons why we choose such topic, and in what method we design and expect to solve the problem.
### Course Registration System Optimization
The problem we found is based on random campus interview, which is a part of work in my supply chain course.
### Paperless Career Fair
The topic we choosed is based on what I have experienced in the career fair.
In addition, in ZeroPaper file, there is a readme, and it is better to take a look before jumping into the code.
